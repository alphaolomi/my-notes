## Alpha's Programming Notes 

I have been writing these notes for a while now, but I have only recently decided to publish them. I write these notes in [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) because it is faster and more lightweight than [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the website from the markdown files hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/alphaolomi/my-notes) and deploy it to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## Why I write these notes

I write these notes to help me remember what I have learned. I also write these notes to help others who are learning to program. I hope that these notes will help you learn to program.
