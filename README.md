# Alpha's Programming Notes [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e18da04f-fd80-411b-abba-94f2ed0cb086/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dancing-maamoul-d6bdf9/deploys)

Welcome to Alpha's Programming Notes! This repository is a curated collection of my programming insights, code snippets, and Today-I-Learned (TIL) entries. It serves as a quick reference guide covering various programming languages, Linux commands, DevOps tools, and more.

## Local Setup

To preview and work on the site locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Serve the site locally
mkdocs serve
```

## Project Context & Workflow

This project is the result of years of accumulated knowledge and learning. I initially started writing these notes for personal use, but I have decided to share them publicly to benefit the wider developer community.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Writing**: I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) because of its speed and lightweight nature.
- **Site Generation**: The site is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator perfect for project documentation.
- **Theme and Extensions**: The theme used is [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), along with various plugins to enhance functionality.
- **Hosting**: The source markdown files are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/alphaolomi/my-notes).
- **Deployment**: The site is deployed via [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and can be accessed at [notes.alphaolomi.dev](https://notes.alphaolomi.dev).

### Recommended Tools

- **IDE**: While I prefer Sublime Text, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is also a great choice for editing markdown and code.
- **Markdown Preview**: Use a markdown previewer like [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/) for a real-time preview of your changes.
- **Obsidian**: Evaluating...
