These are a collection of code snippets I've used in the past and saved. Collection of short snippets, notes and TILs about things related to Programming Languages, Linux, DevOps tools, etc.

mkdocs serve

## Context & Workflow

I have been writing these notes for a while now, but I have only recently decided to publish them. I write these notes in [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)  because it is faster and more lightweight and use [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) with a bunch of extensions and plugins to publish them at [notes.alphaolomi.com](https://notes.alphaolomi.com).
